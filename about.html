                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <img src="images/pic10.jpg" title="name">
                <h5>A little after the turn of the millennium, we - a handful of Indian petrolheads - felt that a common ground was essential for us to do what we were best at – talk cars! There was just one fly in the ointment; that kind of platform didn’t exist yet. We wanted to discuss Indian cars, analyse industry happenings, exchange ownership reviews, share tips &amp; technical information, all of it shoehorned into one definitive knowledge base. GTO took the initiative of creating a tiny forum on MSN Communities called "Formula India". This message board offered little more than a free storage of posts on the MSN website. There were only 10 - 12 active members at the time. Even though the team was small and the features of that proto-community limited, our passion was fathomless. And the spirit strong. Within no time, our group became a valuable repository of car reviews, advice on tuning and owning cars, manufacturer idiosyncrasies, lists of problematic models and more.</h5>
                <p>At some point, our group realized that the information on cars available from traditional media outlets was terribly misleading. This came as no surprise given the financial power of the auto industry’s advertising departments. We firmly believed that the camaraderie of Indian petrolheads deserved better. Driven by the zeal of the inconspicuous MSN community, we decided to build an independent Indian automotive website. We aspired to become a feature-rich community where car enthusiasts could get together and have free access to unbiased &amp; accurate information. It was at this time that the founding team developed an unyielding stance to refuse any and all car advertisements; financial independence from the auto industry was critical to our objectives.</p>

                    <p>We are an autonomous community of, by and for Indian car enthusiasts. Our content is compiled &amp; maintained only by actual car owners from India. RaSh takes pride in the spectacular level of camaraderie and mutual respect maintained on its forums. RaSh does NOT accept car advertisements, and is the only large resource on the Indian Automotive Scene to firmly adopt this stance. Our content is indubitably honest, as we do not accept any sort of direct / indirect advertising rupees for cars. No paid memberships. All the features of RaSh are gratis. The most expansive knowledgebase on the Indian Car Scene; one that's open to and searchable by guests (no registration required). What's more, our collective intelligence grows by a whopping 30,000 posts each month. The wheels that RaShians own are equally diverse. RaSh has reviews on anything that moves....from the Nano to a Ferrari, cycles to superbikes and cargo ships to the Boeing 747. We do everything that can be done with / to our cars. DIYs, modifications, engine swaps, restorations, off-roading, track racing, long-distance touring and more. If there's anything you want to know about any Indian car, chances are that the subject has already been discussed &amp; dissected on our forums. We emphasize road safety and make its importance communicated through several articles and discussions. RaSh strictly prohibits any content proliferating dangerous driving practices (e.g. street racing or drunk driving). A colourful "Shifting Gears" section to discuss the non-automotive aspects of Indian life. The economy, tattoos, gadgets, health &amp; fitness, investments, education, pets, foreign languages, parenting, music gigs and everything else under the sun. Free, full feature Apps for the Android &amp; Apple platforms. We also have a fast &amp; light mobile skin. A beautiful photo gallery with over 10 lakh pictures (and counting) on the Indian Car Scene. A trustworthy RaSh Directory section where members recommend local automotive product &amp; service providers. A vibrant meet section where RaShians get together for weekend drives and meet-ups. This is the website that folks from the car industry &amp; automotive media use to stay connected to the Indian car scene :). Indeed, RaSh is the first &amp; last stop for anything on Indian Cars.</p>
